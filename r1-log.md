### R1D0 16th January, 2024:
1. Prerequisites day: I made a commitment to focus on studying and understanding C# in this [Tweet](https://x.com/sambu_tracy/status/1747338912908116023?s=20).
2. I looked for resources and projects that align with my goals. Luckily, Microsoft has a well documented C# program that meets my expectations. So I signed up for [FreeCodeCamp's Foundational C# with Microsoft course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/foundational-c-sharp-with-microsoft) that will help me to kickstart and understand the basics of the language.

1. Write your first lines of C# code
2. Use two different techniques to print a message to a text console
3. Diagnose errors when you type code incorrectly
4. Identify different C# syntax elements like operators, classes, and methods
