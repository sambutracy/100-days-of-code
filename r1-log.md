The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 17, Wednesday , 2024.

## Log
### R1D0 16th January, 2024:
1. Prerequisites day: I made a commitment to focus on studying and understanding C# in this [Tweet](https://x.com/sambu_tracy/status/1747338912908116023?s=20).
2. I looked for resources and projects that align with my goals. Luckily, Microsoft has a well documented C# program that meets my expectations. So I signed up for [FreeCodeCamp's Foundational C# with Microsoft course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/foundational-c-sharp-with-microsoft) that will help me to kickstart and understand the basics of the language.

### R1D1 17th January, 2024
I started off with the basics of C#. [Tweet](https://x.com/sambu_tracy/status/1747791996213944485?s=20) of today.
I was able to learn the following concepts:
1. Write your first lines of C# code
2. Use two different techniques to print a message to a text console
3. Diagnose errors when you type code incorrectly
4. Identify different C# syntax elements like operators, classes, and methods


### R1D2 18th January 2024
I completed the Store and retrieve data using literal and variable values in C# part of the program.
The learning objectives were:
1. Create literal values for five basic data types
2. Declare and initialize variables
3. Retrieve and set values in variables
4. Allow the compiler to determine the data type for your variable when initializing

### R1D3 19th January 2024
Completed the Perform basic string formatting in C# part.
The objectives were:
1. Create string data containing tabs, new lines, and other special characters
2. Create string data containing Unicode characters
3. Combine string data into a new string value via concatenation
4. Combine string data into a new string value via interpolation

### R1D4 20th January 2024
Completed the Perform basic operations on numbers in C# part.
The objectives were:
1. Perform mathematical operations on numeric values
2. Observe implicit type conversion between strings and numeric values
3. Temporarily convert one data type into another

### R1D5 21st January 2024
Completed the Guided project - Calculate and print student grades.
The objectives were:
1. Learn to develop basic applications by breaking down the work into smaller parts
2. Identify appropriate data types for storing and working with variables
3. Perform mathematical operations to determine results
4. Apply formatting techniques to display output

### R1D6 22nd January 2024
Took a break from c# and focussed on Python Exceptions.
Objectives:
1. Learn difference between errors and exceptions,what exceptions are and how to use them
2. when we need to use exceptions and how to correctly handle them
3. purpose of catching exceptions and how to raise a built in exception
4. When to implement a clean up action after an exception

### R1D7 23rd January 2024
